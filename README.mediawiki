<dt style="font-weight:bold">There are already so many journaling application systems. Why create yet another?</dt>
<dd>
<p>While I have indeed found plenty of option,
<a href="https://jrnl.sh/en/stable/">jrnl</a>, even 
some having features that I'd like, 
they seem to be a bit more complicated than I'd like.</p>
<p>Also having made a tool to do my finances, 
so that I can do that nearly anywhere, I thought I would make my own.</p>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">Why the name nikki?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sometimes, it can be hard to come up with a name, 
especially if you want it to stand out.</p>
<p>I was going to it chronicle, but as the name was taken, 
I decided to try to look up a word in Japanese meaning diary
and I found that nikki had that meaning and nobody really used it, 
except for maybe the anime/manga series <cite>Mirai Nikki</cite>, 
so I decided to go with that.</p>
